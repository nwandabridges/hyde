title: The First Post on a New Site
---

Moving into a new home, replacing a notebook, cleaning up old code. All of these things scratch an itch, replacing clutter with order.  

I feel the same way about creating this website. It's a fresh start, free of junk, kipple, and cruft. As of February 14, 2018, everything on this site is functional, clean, and orderly.  

It won't be this way forever.

> Nature’s first green is gold, 
> Her hardest hue to hold. 
> Her early leaf’s a flower; 
> But only so an hour. 
> Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
> So Eden sank to grief, 
> So dawn goes down to day. 
> Nothing gold can stay.  
> -*Robert Frost*
