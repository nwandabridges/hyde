**I’ve Moved**  
[Gary the Privacy Concern Clown](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/857837608046436354?lang=en) warned me that I shouldn't share this information, but I'm sharing it anyway. **I moved last week.**  
  
Like any big change, the *idea* of moving makes me uncomfortable. The anticpation of schlepping all of those boxes downstairs, into a truck, and up a different set of stairs makes me want to curl up in the fetal position.  
  
But that feeling quickly passes as the dreaded event comes and goes. The discomfort gives way to excitement.  
#### I'm excited because change is good.
 
Being forced to confront all of the physical baggage that I've accumulated since the last move creates a natural opportunity to simplify.  
  
How much of this stuff do I actually need? Does caring for this *thing* require more effort than the amount of utility it provides? When was the last time I used it?  
  
**It's time to get rid of the crap and make space for the things I care about.**
